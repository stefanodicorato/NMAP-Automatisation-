### TO BE DONE

To save a bash script, you need to create a text file with the desired commands and save it with a .sh extension. For example, you can create a file called port_scanner.sh and add the contents of the script. To make the file executable, run the following command in terminal:
chmod +x port_scanner.sh

To run the script, you can now specify the target IP address directly in the terminal, like this:
./port_scanner.sh

At the promp insert the Target IP:
[target_ip_address]
